Welcome to dbconn!

This is a very simple MySQL library that should be used for all data transfer scripts that need to use python.
This will allow us to have one maintainable way to connect to databases needed for any data transfer needs.
This library also allows for scripts to easily use their own database users.

TO USE:
 1) Create a virtual environment for python 2.7 or below
        virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.7 venv

 2) Source the virtual environment
        source venv/bin/activate

 3) Install dbconn (Make sure your ssh key has been added to you bitbucket account and you have been added
    to the datatransfer team)
        pip install git+ssh://git@bitbucket.org/datatransfer/dbconn.git

 4) If the library needs to be upgraded
        pip install git+ssh://git@bitbucket.org/datatransfer/dbconn.git --upgrade
